# EGR433

This is code to control a Quanser Qube Servo 2 with a raspberry pi over SPI. This is for a class project in the EGR433 Transforms and Systems Modeling class at ASU. The goal of the project is to impliment various control systems on this hardware to compare their performance.

serial_communication.py and qube_control.py are the programs used to interface with the Qube.

The other programs are for controlling the Qube with different control systems. Additionally, some data has been saved for plotting the response and state over time.
