# EGR433

This is code to control a Quanser Qube Servo 2 with a raspberry pi over SPI.

serial_communication.py and qube_control.py are the programs used to interface with the Qube.

The other programs are for controlling the Qube with different control systems. Additionally, some data has been saved for plotting the response and state over time.
